# Anime I'm watching

A CMS website built with Lektor and Bootstrap 5 listing anime that I'm watching.

Start with `lektor server` and visit http://127.0.0.1:5000/ to see the website.

## Adding a new anime

Go to the admin panel (pencil button in the top right corner) and add a new page. The fields are pretty self-explanatory.

## Editing existing anime

Go to the admin panel (pencil button in the top right corner) and click on the subpage to edit.
